            Before you purchase your water tanks, you need to figure out how big the tanks need to be.
The things to consider here are:
- How long you want to go before having to empty your grey and black water tanks and re-fill your freshwater.
- How much water you would need in that timeframe (drinking, showering, dishes, etc.).
- Storage capacity on your van (this depends on where youâ€™re storing your tanks and your van layout.
- How much weight you can add to your van along with everything else in your conversion.

            Water Tank Placement | Inside vs Outside the Van

Most people will mount their tanks on the outside of their van as a way to save on precious interior space. This is exactly what I had done in my first van.
The only time this would become a problem is if you plan on doing any winter traveling. Winter climates could lead to freezing in your freshwater tank and pipes if stored underneath the vehicle. This is why I eventually added 2 additional tanks inside the van.
(And yes, I still have my grey water going to the outside of the van and will sometimes add anti-freeze to the tank.)
